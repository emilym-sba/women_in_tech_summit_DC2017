This workshop will introduce RSS and API access with Python. There are [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/nd1/women_in_tech_summit_DC2017/tree/master/workshop_notebooks) that walks through both in Python. I have included an [api script](https://github.com/nd1/women_in_tech_summit_DC2017/tree/master/api) you can try out and modify for your own use!

The notebook and script are written for Python 3.
